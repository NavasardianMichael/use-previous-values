<!-- About The Hook -->
## About The Hook

The project provides a unique functionality related to JavaScript dates. It allows to generate repeating dates array according to a certain shape of input data. Its name is in harmony with its essence: the exported function gives an opportunity to generate additional properties (except of dates) based on the date of the current iteration.
There are some recurring date utilities, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/recurring-date">recurring-date</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-recur">moment-recur</a> available on NPM. But the first is class based and for second the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment">moment</a> is a must. So I didn't find one that really suited my needs when I ran into the problem of providing such functionalityâ€¤ Eventually I created this enhanced one, which is function based, suitable for TypeScript, and does not need additional mapping for custom data.


Of course, it is new and there can be some missing cases of logic. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

```sh
npm install recur-date-based
```
 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Here are presented all the available props the exported function accepts.

| Ppropery                   | Type                 | Description  | Default    |
| -------------------------- | -------------        | ------------ | ----------- |
| start                      | string               | the start date string in ISO format | today        |
| end                        | number or string      | occurences count or the end date string in ISO format. The number larger than 9999 is not applicable. | 100 |
| interval                   | number      | repeat by some interval | 10 |
| intervalType               | day / week / month / year | interval measue unit | day |
| localeString.lang          | string | the first argument that recieves the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString">Date.toLocaleString</a> function | null |
| localeString.formatOptions          | Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions | the second argument that recieves the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString">Date.toLocaleString</a> function | null |
| extended                   | { [key: string]: (args: {date: Date, dateStr: Date}) => any } | The object accepts provided functions under any string key. The function receives an object with date and dateStr options in the current iteration. This can help to generate extended properties based on current occurence | null |

Check out an example.

```sh
import { genRecurDateBasedList } from 'recur-date-based';

genRecurDateBasedList({
    start: '2022-07-01T19:00:00',
    interval: 3,
    intervalType: 'week',
    end: '2022-07-30T19:00:00',
    localeString: {
        lang: 'fr-CH',
        formatOptions: {
            timeZone: 'America/New_York',
            hourCycle: 'h24',
            year: "numeric",
            month: "2-digit",
            day: "2-digit",
            hour: "2-digit",
            minute: "2-digit",
            second: "2-digit"
        }
    },
    extended: {
        isMonday: ({date}) => date.getDay() === 1,
        getDateOnly: ({dateStr}) => dateStr.substring(0, 8),
    }
}
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Finalize the initial version
- [x] Add extended props callbacks
- [ ] Add exclude functionality
- [ ] Support other intervalTypes
- [ ] Support date short formatting (e.g. dd/mm/yyyy)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/NavasardianMichael/recur-date-based/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
